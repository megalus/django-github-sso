# How Django GitHub SSO works?

## Current Flow

1. First, the user is redirected to the Django login page. If settings `GITHUB_SSO_ENABLED` is True, the
"Login with GitHub" button will be added to a default form.

2. On click, **Django-GitHub-SSO** will add, in a anonymous request session, the `sso_next_url` and GitHub Auth info.
This data will expire in 10 minutes. Then user will be redirected to GitHub login page.

    !!! info "Using Request Anonymous session"
        If you make any actions which change or destroy this session, like restart django, clear cookies or change
        browsers, ou move between `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, the login will fail, and you can see the message
        "State Mismatched. Time expired?" in the next time you log in again. Also remember the anonymous session
        lasts for 10 minutes, defined in`GITHUB_SSO_TIMEOUT`.

3. On callback, **Django-GitHub-SSO** will check `code` and `state` received. If they are valid,
GitHub's UserInfo will be retrieved. If the user is already registered in Django, the user
will be logged in.

4. Otherwise, the user will be created and logged in, if his email domain,
matches one of the `GITHUB_SSO_ALLOWABLE_DOMAINS`. You can disable the auto-creation setting `GITHUB_SSO_AUTO_CREATE_USERS`
to False.

5. On creation only, this user can be set to the`staff` or `superuser` status, if his email are in `GITHUB_SSO_STAFF_LIST` or
`GITHUB_SSO_SUPERUSER_LIST` respectively. Please note if you add an email to one of these lists, the email domain
must be added to `GITHUB_SSO_ALLOWABLE_DOMAINS`too.

6. This authenticated session will expire in 1 hour, or the time defined, in seconds, in `GITHUB_SSO_SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`.

7.  If login fails, you will be redirected to route defined in `GOOGLE_SSO_LOGIN_FAILED_URL` (default: `admin:index`)
which will use Django Messaging system to show the error message.

8. If login succeeds, the user will be redirected to the `next_path` saved in the anonymous session, or to the route
defined in `GOOGLE_SSO_NEXT_URL` (default: `admin:index`) as a fallback.

## The `define_sso_providers` template tag
**Django-Microsoft-SSO** uses this tag to define which buttons to show on the login page. This is because the same tag is
used in other libraries, like [django-google-sso](https://github.com/megalus/django-google-sso) and
[django-github-sso](https://github.com/megalus/django-github-sso). This tag checks the `*_SSO_ENABLED`, `*_SSO_ADMIN_ENABLED`
and `*_SSO_PAGES_ENABLED` settings to return a list of enabled SSO providers for the current request.

if you need to customize this, you can pass in the request context the `sso_providers` variable with a list of providers to show, like this:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    ...
    sso_providers = [
        {
            "name": "Microsoft",
            "logo_url": "...", # URL for the button logo
            "text": "...",  # Text for the button
            "login_url": "...",  # URL to redirect to start the login flow
            "css_url": "...",  # URL for the button CSS
         }
    ]
    return render(request, "my_login_template.html", {"sso_providers": sso_providers})
```

Also, if you're using async views, you can run the original template tags, like this:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django_github_sso.utils import adefine_sso_providers, adefine_show_form

async def my_async_view(request):
    ...
    context = {
        "show_admin_form": await adefine_show_form(request),
        "sso_providers": await adefine_sso_providers(request)
    }
    return render(request, "my_login_template.html", context)
```

!!! tip "The same is valid for define_show_form tag"
    You can pass in the request context the `show_admin_form` variable with a boolean value to show or hide
    the default login form.
